Example for implementation Rest API using Spring Boot.

## Requirement
Java 25+ (Spring Boot 4)

## Build
`./mvnw clean install`

## Database
Database uses in-memory DB H2. It will automatically build and export the required tables and data.

The H2 console (`/h2-console`, JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:test`) is available while running with devtools, e.g. `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. It is not served by the packaged jar.

## Calling SDLC systems (RestClient example)
`GET /api/v2/projects/{id}/external` looks the project up in its SDLC system with Spring's `RestClient`
(`SdlcProjectClient`, Jira-style `GET {baseUrl}/rest/api/2/project/{externalId}`):

- `200` with the system's `key`, `name` and `description`
- `404` if the project is unknown here or in the SDLC system
- `502` if the SDLC system fails or answers without a project, if connecting takes longer than
  `spring.http.clients.connect-timeout`, if the response stalls for longer than
  `spring.http.clients.read-timeout` (a per-read socket timeout, not a total deadline), or if no pooled
  connection frees up within `resourceapi.http-client.pool.connection-request-timeout`

Requests go through a pooled Apache HttpClient 5 (`PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager`), so connections to an
SDLC system are kept alive and reused. The pool is sized with `resourceapi.http-client.pool.*`
(`max-total` 50, `max-per-route` 10, `connection-request-timeout` 2s, `idle-timeout` 30s, `time-to-live` 5m);
see `HttpClientPoolProperties` and `HttpClientPoolConfig`. All `RestClient` calls share Boot's single
request factory, so there is one pool for the application, closed on shutdown.

The client is tested against [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) (`SdlcProjectClientTest`, `ExternalProjectIntegrationTest`,
and `SdlcProjectClientPoolingTest`, which counts the connections actually opened).

## Testing
There are scripts to test the Rest API in Postman.
